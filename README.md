# Machine Learning Models with R/Python

This repository contains my implementation of several supervised machine learning models for data analysis and prediction tasks. The models were built using real datasets, with focus on performance comparison and tuning.

## Models Implemented

- **Linear Regression**: Applied to a regression problem to predict continuous target variables using one or more independent variables.
- **Decision Tree**: Used for both classification and regression, including pruning and hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search and Random Search.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method combining multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

## Techniques Used

- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, outliers, encoding, scaling
- Model evaluation: RMSE, RÂ², confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall
- Model tuning: GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV
- k-Fold Cross Validation

## Tools and Libraries

- R: `ggplot2`, `caret`, `randomForest`
- Python: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
